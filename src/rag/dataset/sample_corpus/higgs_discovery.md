# The Discovery of the Higgs Boson at the LHC

## Introduction

The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012 was a landmark achievement in particle physics, confirming a key prediction of the Standard Model that had been made nearly 50 years earlier. Both the ATLAS and CMS experiments independently observed a new particle with a mass of approximately 125 GeV/c², consistent with the long-sought Higgs boson.

## The Higgs Mechanism

The Higgs mechanism explains how elementary particles acquire mass through their interaction with the Higgs field, a quantum field that permeates all of space. The strength of a particle's interaction with this field determines its mass. Particles like photons do not interact with the Higgs field and remain massless, while particles like the W and Z bosons have strong interactions and are massive.

The Higgs field has a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV):

$$
v = \langle 0 | \phi | 0 \rangle \approx 246 \text{ GeV}
$$

This VEV is responsible for spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking, giving mass to the weak force carriers:

$$
M_W = \frac{1}{2} g v \approx 80.4 \text{ GeV/c}^2
$$

$$
M_Z = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{g^2 + g'^2} v \approx 91.2 \text{ GeV/c}^2
$$

where $g$ and $g'$ are the weak and hypercharge coupling constants.

## Discovery Channels

The Higgs boson was discovered through multiple decay channels, with the two most significant being:

### 1. H → γγ (Diphoton Channel)

The Higgs decay to two photons occurs through loop diagrams involving heavy particles, primarily the top quark and W boson. Despite being a rare decay mode with a branching ratio of only ~0.2%, this channel provides excellent mass resolution:

$$
H \rightarrow \gamma\gamma
$$

The invariant mass of the diphoton system is calculated as:

$$
M_{\gamma\gamma} = \sqrt{2 E_1 E_2 (1 - \cos\theta_{12})}
$$

where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the photon energies and $\theta_{12}$ is the angle between them.

### 2. H → ZZ* → 4ℓ (Four-Lepton Channel)

This "golden channel" offers the cleanest signal with excellent mass resolution. One Z boson is on-shell while the other is off-shell (Z*):

$$
H \rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow 4\ell \quad (\ell = e, \mu)
$$

The four-lepton invariant mass is reconstructed from the four-momenta:

$$
M_{4\ell} = \sqrt{(\sum_{i=1}^{4} E_i)^2 - (\sum_{i=1}^{4} \vec{p}_i)^2}
$$

## Production Mechanisms

At the LHC, the Higgs boson is produced through several mechanisms:

1. **Gluon-gluon fusion (ggF)**: The dominant production mode (~90%) occurs through a top quark loop:
   $$pp \rightarrow H + X$$

2. **Vector boson fusion (VBF)**: Produces distinctive forward jets:
   $$pp \rightarrow Hjj + X$$

3. **Associated production with vector bosons**: 
   $$pp \rightarrow WH, ZH$$

4. **Associated production with top quarks**:
   $$pp \rightarrow t\bar{t}H$$

## Experimental Signatures

The discovery relied on identifying an excess of events in the invariant mass distributions around 125 GeV. Key experimental signatures included:

- **Event selection**: Isolated leptons with high transverse momentum ($p_T > 20$ GeV)
- **Trigger requirements**: High-$p_T$ photon or lepton triggers
- **Background rejection**: Discriminants against $Z + \gamma$ and $t\bar{t}$ backgrounds
- **Mass resolution**: ~1-2% for $H \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$, ~1-2 GeV for $H \rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow 4\ell$

## Statistical Significance

The discovery was announced on July 4, 2012, when both experiments observed a signal with a local significance exceeding 5 standard deviations (5σ):

- **ATLAS**: 5.9σ combined significance
- **CMS**: 5.0σ combined significance

The probability of such an excess arising from background fluctuations alone is less than 1 in 3.5 million.

## Higgs Boson Properties

Subsequent measurements have characterized the Higgs boson:

- **Mass**: $M_H = 125.09 \pm 0.24$ GeV/c² (combined ATLAS+CMS)
- **Spin**: $J = 0$ (scalar particle)
- **Parity**: Positive ($P = +1$)
- **Charge conjugation**: $C = +1$ (CP-even)
- **Total width**: $\Gamma_H < 9.2$ MeV (95% CL), consistent with SM prediction of ~4.1 MeV

## Coupling Measurements

The measured couplings to other particles are consistent with Standard Model predictions:

$$
\kappa_f = \frac{g_{Hff}^{\text{obs}}}{g_{Hff}^{\text{SM}}}
$$

where $\kappa_f \approx 1$ indicates SM-like couplings. Current measurements show:

- $\kappa_W = 1.05 \pm 0.10$
- $\kappa_Z = 1.01 \pm 0.09$
- $\kappa_t = 1.07 \pm 0.12$
- $\kappa_b = 0.99 \pm 0.15$
- $\kappa_\tau = 1.09 \pm 0.11$

## Impact and Future Directions

The Higgs discovery:

1. Confirmed the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism
2. Completed the Standard Model particle content
3. Earned François Englert and Peter Higgs the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics
4. Opened new avenues for beyond-Standard-Model searches

Future measurements will focus on:

- Rare decay channels (e.g., $H \rightarrow \mu\mu$, $H \rightarrow Z\gamma$)
- Higgs self-coupling measurements via $HH$ production
- CP properties in $H \rightarrow \tau\tau$ decays
- Precision measurements of all couplings
- Searches for exotic Higgs decays
